<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Dear Writing Faculty, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Thank you.
Throughout my schooling, I was simply told to ‘add evidence’ or ‘be more
persuasive’ without being shown how. Somehow, experts on communication, could
not communicate. However, here, my questions have been answered. Consequently,
I have grown as a critical writer and am ready to face my undergraduate writing
career. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>I am most
indebted, perhaps, for being shown how to rigorously identify and articulate
the elements of reasoning<span style='color:black'>. I learned the first two
elements, reasons and evidence, from our discussion of D. Farris’ article. </span>Since
then, I have internalized the difference between the two: a reason is a
proposition that, if shown, implies the larger proposition whereas evidence is
an instance of a reason occurring in real life. Now I understand how to answer
‘why?’ and how providing an example in place of a reason does not do so.
Understanding the last and paramount element of reasoning, analysis, was more
challenging.  From high school, I thought analysis was merely a breaking into
parts. Until we clearly defined propositions and premises in class, I was a
pencil without paper. After those definitions sunk in, I became aware that some
statements are accepted by a reader and others need to use the former
statements to be shown. Subsequently, I see analysis is connecting a
proposition to a chain of reasons, the last a premise. The breaking into parts
occurs between links, describing the parts of a former statement in a manner
that implies the latter. With this knowledge, I can pinpoint errors and
articulate solutions. Now, it is upon this sense of, this feel for
propositions, premises, reasons, and evidence that I compose; I command my
reasoning.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>This control is
evident in my research paper. To show my proposition that Archilochus’ cologne
epode includes the purpose of depicting the speaker’s emotional resolution, I
show that the speaker hates seeing himself as hasty. This required nuance in
distinguishing the speaker’s words as evidence and a statement about the
speaker as a reason. So, with critical thought, I wrote down my reason: the
speaker hated viewing himself as hasty because he was excessive in his attack
on Neobule. From this, I claimed he was not trying to be rhetorical. Then, I
concluded the excessiveness was emotional, an outburst of anger. Finally, I
illustrated my point by stating the premise: hating another for being a certain
way implies one would hate being that way. I ensured my writing was grounded
through this process of outlining my analysis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>This experience
was unlike anything I had done in high school. Back then, I only followed examples:
writing mimicking that which had succeeded before or was presented in class.
Presently, I follow reasons.  Observe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>More
than Pleasure: Archilochus’ Cologne Epode</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Much is
confusing about the purpose of Archilochus’s cologne epode. Many scholars see
it as dramatic iambic entertainment. They note the speaker’s rhetorical skill
in maneuvering through the maiden’s worries and suggest the purpose is to
depict this art of seduction. Other scholars are convinced that the epode is an
attack at the Lycambids: the younger daughter shamed by deflowering and the
older shamed through verbal attack. Some scholars see a mix. Regardless, a view
on the speaker’s emotions emerges. Both seem to think the speaker is simply
after pleasure and that the poet either uses this to shame the Lycambids or
depict a masculine show of the art of seduction (or some mixture). Here, I note
a third understanding of the speaker’s emotions<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a>:
he despises the self-image that he is hasty and reckless like Neobule. Using
this understanding, I will show the purpose of the poem includes a depiction of
the speaker resolving his emotions by eradicating this self-image.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The speaker’s hatred of viewing
himself as hasty like Neobule is evident through the excessive emotion
displayed in his attack on Neobule. For instance, the speaker gets so riled up
at one point that he exclaims “Go to hell! May [Zeus] not send this upon me so
that I… will be a source of shame to my neighbors.”<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[2]</span></span></span></a>
He is so angry that he exclaims in apostrophe, imagining he is speaking directly
to Neobule. Further, he calls out to the mighty Zeus to not send ‘this’
(Neobule) on him as though ‘this’ was some tragedy like the death of a family
member. The image is of him yelling out to Neobule and Zeus while directly in
front of the maiden. Such anger is not seductive (yelling ‘go to hell’) and
thus, not some rhetorical means of convincing the girl. This is an emotional
outburst of hating how ‘easy’ and wanton Neobule is. One can imagine how upset
the speaker would be at the thought of seeing himself with this characteristic
he has denounced. Rubin<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[3]</span></span></span></a>
argues this point thoroughly. She shows the attack was an “outlet for [the
speaker’s] emotional excess” by looking at how harshly the speaker contrasts
the two potential relationships<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[4]</span></span></span></a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The speaker’s loathing at seeing
himself as hasty is also evident through the rhetorical context of the
invective: the speaker’s attempt to demonstrate to the maiden that he is not
hasty and a fit for Neobule. The maiden accuses the speaker of being hasty,
uncontrolled and a match for Neobule and he responds to this with his attack on
Neobule. She says, if, instead of waiting until after marriage to be with her,
his “heart is pressing right through” him, he can go to a paradoxically
‘delicate, beautiful maiden’ who really wants relations<a href="#_ftn5"
name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[5]</span></span></span></a>.
She taunts the speaker by suggesting that he should go to the undesirable,
wanton Neobule- a perfect match for his present haste. In his response, he
presents three points<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[6]</span></span></span></a>
before the attack on Neobule: 1) they can do some lesser pleasure of Aphrodite,
2) they can have full coitus<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[7]</span></span></span></a>
much later (presumably after marriage)<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[8]</span></span></span></a>
and, 3) he will be contraceptive and do coitus interruptus<a href="#_ftn9"
name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[9]</span></span></span></a>.
All this sounds perfect, not at all hasty, and completely agreeable but, the
speaker knows that the maiden is skeptical that he is just saying anything he
can to trick her and have full coitus. What is missing is the proof that he is
what he says he is. Thus, he attacks Neobule for her hastiness to show that he
truly does hate uncontrolled behavior and will not behave that way himself<a
href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[10]</span></span></span></a>.
Now, that the speaker gets emotional and angry at Neobule for her haste while
trying to show that he is not hasty suggests that he truly loathes thinking of
himself as hasty. The speaker is defending himself and in doing so gets
passionate (and unrhetorical as seen by his yelling) because he really despises
the self-view the maiden has suggested of him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The speaker’s discomfort at him being a
reckless, hasty person clarifies a few central aspects of the epode. First, the
ending in which the speaker ‘comes into shore at grassy gardens’ is resolved. His
motivation for his action is unclear. If the epode’s primary purpose is to
shame the Lycambids, why is the speaker treating the maiden respectfully by
keeping his promise?<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span> On the other
hand, if the epode is more of a depiction of the heroic wooing of a girl, then
why does the speaker restrain himself from taking as much pleasure as he can?<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span>In any case, the speaker restrains himself
from the “divine”<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[11]</span></span></span></a>
pleasure when one would expect him to do otherwise.<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[12]</span></span></a></span>
However, if the speaker were to break his promise, he would be like Neobule-
hasty and “two-faced.”<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[13]</span></span></span></a>
Because the speaker is disgusted by this idea, despite all the tension of the
moment, he keeps his promise and proves to himself that he is not like Neobule
and has restraint. Similarly, the speaker is deeply affirmed when he convinces
the maiden, who at the start of the epode, thought he was hasty. The maiden, by
the end, is revealing her own skin and trusting the speaker<a href="#_ftn14"
name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[14]</span></span></span></a>.
In light of this disgust the speaker has for seeing himself as hasty, this
trust by someone who was unsure at first is deeply affirming; the self-view
that he is hasty has been destroyed because she who presented the view has been
convinced. This gives new meaning to the trust the iambic seducer typically
wishes to gain. Here, unlike the traditional seduction, the speaker cares that the
girl believes him not because it will allow him to have relations, but because <i>he
wants to be good</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            These two affirmations in the ending demonstrate
the poem’s purpose includes a depiction of the speaker’s emotional resolution;
the speaker tries to eradicate the perception of him as thoughtless and hasty
by convincing this maiden and then keeping his promise. However, this begs the
question of why Archilochus would include this purpose as part of his poem.
Perhaps the speaker’s discomfort is Archilochus’. This would suggest that
Archilochus gives more than a simple depiction of seduction, but rather real
comments on good and bad relationships, good and bad characteristics- both from
experience of some Neobule<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>[15]</span></span></span></a>.
In brief, perhaps Archilochus’s pain lends not simply a seductive tale, but
wisdom on what is and what looks like positive love. </p>

situation as having the possibility of two relationships and denying one
through “a vehement and abusive attack on Neobule’s character” which “may
correlate with a former excessive passion”.  Rubin observes the speaker fears
“I may bring forth dark and sinful things just as a bitch, swiftly being
aroused” (pg. 138-39). She explains that the speaker actually fears a renewed
relationship with Neobule or one like it because being hasty and choosing Neobule
would ‘equate him with whom he has denounced as the worst’ – something he would
hate. So, the speaker hates this image of himself as the type of person who is
a match for Neobule and denounces this possible relationship.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>  First, Van Sickle has shown that
because the girl chooses to stay and reason with the speaker (despite the
obvious risk of rape in that time) and she proposes that they ‘endure’ until
marriage, she is interested in the speaker. Then, on her suggesting Neobule,
Van Sickle notes the idea of an eager woman is “at odds” with the “image of a”
beautiful, soft girl. He shows the girl is ‘pushing unsuitable merchandise’ (pg.
5-6). I disagree on his explanation for why and instead agree with Eckerman’s
view: “flirtation is a game.” Eckerman suggests the maiden playfully “points to
the impropriety of the male’s advances” by proposing a hasty match for him (pg.
11-13). However, I disagree with Eckerman’s use of this observed taunting for
the purpose of arguing that the offered girl was a slave girl. Eckerman relies
on the ambiguity of ‘in my house’ to make his case. The phrase ‘in my house’ is
ambiguous because the audience was aware of the Archilochean myth or stock
characters which meant the reference was obviously to Neobule. </span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> I agree with Rubin that the attack
“offers a negative exemplum of excess for the narrator who separates or
isolates himself from Neobule’s excesses” (pg. 140). I demonstrate this idea
differently by analyzing the points made by the speaker and the elephant in the
room- that he could just be lying to get what he wants (and thus he provides
evidence of why he hates hastiness).  </span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> Rankin and Henderson see the
speaker as a “detached sensualist” (Rankin 607) trying to achieve full coitus
“by whatever means necessary” (Henderson 169). Henderson uses this as a reason
to argue the ending is full coitus. Regardless, the speaker keeping his promise
is unexpected and brings up the question of his motivation. West and Eckerman
view the speaker as an “enthralled lover” who is depicted in a “sexual
adventure” to an iambic audience (West 218-19). In this case as well, coitus
interruptus seems out of character, “too unheroic” to fit a theme of “sexual
conquest” (Eckerman 17). I present a strong emotion to explain this highly
unusual action: the speaker’s hatred of seeing himself like Neobule. Further, Henderson’s
explanation of full coitus is quite perplexing in light of this emotion. </span></p>
