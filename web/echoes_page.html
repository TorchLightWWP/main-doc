        <h1>Echoes</h1><h3>The Literary and Art Magazine</h3><br/>
        <p>
            Echoes is South's official literary and art magazine, which offers
            a compilation of works from the student body in an annual publication
            produced at the end of the year. It has been around for most of South's
            history, having been founded in 1974 and is still active to this day.
            Each year, members of the club review and critique student submissions
            and vote on which pieces will be present in the magazine. The club also
            offers various art and writing workshops for its members, directed by the
            Art and Literary Editors. The issues of the magazine can be found in the
            library, the art rooms, and various language art rooms for all to enjoy.
            The magazine comes at no charge and is based on a theme that combines the
            variety of art and literary works accepted.
