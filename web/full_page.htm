line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This document serves one
main purpose. To educate students (and parents) about how the school system
works so that everyone has an equal opportunity to get into the best colleges
in the world. Normally, this valuable information is kept hidden from the majority
of students and only a few elite students know how to get into colleges like
Harvard. The point of this document TORCHLIGHT is to fight the shadiness. This
concept of <!-- � Some trash from MS -->shadiness<!-- � Some trash from MS --> or <!-- � Some trash from MS -->shady<!-- � Some trash from MS --> behavior is best illustrated with examples:
one student gets into MIT because of doing research with a professor that
happens to be a family member. Another, student somehow appears in a
multivariable calculus class in his or her sophomore year. Basically, shadiness
is the behavior of getting something that puts one is great shape for college
admissions by using some information or resource no one else either knew about
or had access to. Hence, we named the document TORCHLIGHT to shine light on
this hidden information. </span></p>

acceptance, rejection and wait listing (also deferral in some cases).
Acceptance and rejection are obvious; but wait listing is when, if they have a
few open spots towards the end of their enrollment period, they may or may not
accept you. Some colleges have a ranked waitlist where they tell you the order
in which they will accept students when spots allow it. You may want to ask
about this when waitlisted from a college, to know your probability of getting
in.</p>

way earlier (do not wait till your senior year) - as many have long lists of
students to write for.<!-- � Some trash from MS --> THIS IS THE SAME FOR COACHES OR OTHERS. I put this in

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a website that many colleges use (especially the top
few) to simplify the process by requiring all the material one must submit to
be in the same place. Generally all students make a common application account
on the common application website. On this account, students will add colleges
they want to apply to using the add college tab. Once this has been done,
students have to do 2 things:<!-- � Some trash from MS --> fill out the common information tab that all
your colleges need and fill out the specific tab that has the information the
college needs - which just asks questions about you, your interests, and
perhaps asks for a supplemental essay on why you are interested in that
college. Basically just look up on the internet how the common app works. There
are a plethora of YouTube videos about this. Also note, there is a special way
to add teacher, coach and other recommendations. Some schools will connect a Naviance
account to your common app and do teacher recommendations that way- which is
what our school district does. Note that you can do non-teacher recommendations
by emailing a person via a process on the common app (look it up on the common
app website or google- how to do non-teacher recommendations). But note, you
should, like you do with other teacher recommendations, contact the coach or

express all the needed and optional information. It is pretty obvious how to do
so when you are on the site. Some notes though: be concise- especially with
your optional essay in which you can say anything you could not say in other
parts of the application (remember someone has to read everything in like 15
minutes). Another note: be careful in selecting what your interests are- don<!-- � Some trash from MS -->t
put down random topics. Select interests that you have done things with (i.e.
if you are president of math club and have won many math competitions- mention
your interest is math not psychology). Essentially, colleges like someone who
is interested in majors he or she has demonstrated passion and success in.
However, we will get to this topic later. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IMPORTANT NOTE: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>All test scores (AP test, SAT, ACT,
SAT subject tests) are simply reported through the Collegeboard website (look
this up online- search Collegeboard on google) that mails the info to your
applied colleges. This needs to be done at least 3 weeks in advance of your
first college application submission deadline (the date by which you must
submit your application to be considered- shown on the <!-- � Some trash from MS -->Apply to &lt;insert
college name&gt;<!-- � Some trash from MS --> page on a college<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s website). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>These test scores must be reported
this way regardless of whether the school uses the common app website or not.<!-- � Some trash from MS --> </p>

the college<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s website</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><!-- � Some trash from MS --></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many colleges do not use the common app website to apply and
require you to simply submit your information through their website. Their
specific process will be explained on their website (you usually make an
account and then fill out a few forms). It usually collects the same
information that is given via the common app. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>THE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE is that all recommendations must be
mailed (to a place the college<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s website will specify) or done through some website
(- SEE YOUR GUIDANCE COUNSELOR FOR SCHOOLS LIKE RUTGERS). This is usually the
only way they will receive it. Also note, that you have to tell your teachers
and coaches (through a method that your school will probably organize) which
colleges use the common app- so the teacher can just submit the recommendation
online through naviance and which need you the teacher/coach.. To mail their
recommendation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>After the college applications,
there is a separate process for financial aid. There are loans and scholarships
offered by the state and the university. Usually, your and your parents<!-- � Some trash from MS --> tax
information will be asked for in various applications (see the <!-- � Some trash from MS -->Financial Aid<!-- � Some trash from MS -->

there is a deadline for your acceptance of the college<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s offer. Accept an offer
and then, if you like, reject the others (rejection is assumed if you don<!-- � Some trash from MS -->t
accept the offer by a deadline). Once you accept a college<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s offer, that
college will have its own process for enrollment (which is a word that means
basically registering to go to the college). Immunizations, housing
applications, meal plans and course selections are among the things usually
determined here. This is not complicated, and by this time you are essentially
done with the college process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that all of these are personal. A part of your decision
should be based on how you feel about a college. Academics are not all that you
will do at college - you have to feel comfortable, at home - as if you <!-- � Some trash from MS -->fit.<!-- � Some trash from MS --></p>

list, not make it - it would be too inconvenient to visit every interesting
college. On a college visit, there is usually a campus tour which would explain
the basics of daily life - the meal plans, the security, the dorms and the
physical layout of the campus. Also, colleges may offer specific information
sessions for programs and related things. These give you vital statistics and
an opportunity to talk to people involved the in program, letting you make
connections or simply learn more. Some colleges will let you sit in on classes
and maybe let you spend a night. These would help you get much more connected
to the college and understand what your life in that institution would be like.</p>

possible to search colleges based on scores, distances, majors and many other
variables. You can then save searches, compare your GPA and SAT score to that
of previous high school applicants and see where you stand. Note that average

are a few important things to know. Colleges on this list are ranked by your
likelihood of getting in. Safety schools will most probably accept you and
offer perks such as merit-based scholarships. Having two or three of these
would be nice to ensure that you do go to some college. Target schools are
colleges that you would get into, but with competition and a chance of
rejection. These should make the bulk of your list - around 4-5 colleges. That
would leave space for a few reach schools. These colleges are ones where you are
unsure about getting in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoTitle><a name=h.14ovst6vcjcl></a>THE FIRST LEVEL: relatively good
schools</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>First, we start with things looked
for by the relatively good schools. Some would argue that places like Rutgers
and Penn state are good schools (schools is another term for colleges). In
reality they are but our school system prepares students relatively well for
these schools- so long as you maintain a B average and maybe a few honors
classes. Thus, here when we talk about good schools we reference a rather broad
range of schools from schools that fall under a category called Hidden ivies
(which includes the subcategory of mini ivies) to the lower level ivy league
colleges itself.<!-- � Some trash from MS --> I will explain these two categories of good schools:</p>

The top
few hidden ivies are called mini ivies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Mini ivies are colleges that are
not part of the Ivy League but are a tier below the Ivy League. These are
pretty good colleges that set students on great paths. Here is a list of almost
all of them:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here are the best few (that actually rival the Ivy League :)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amherst, Bowdoin, Middlebury, Swarthmore, Wesleyan,
University of Chicago and Williams</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Note: colleges like Williams, University Of Chicago and
Swarthmore are seriously up there in the ivy league- like perhaps above Cornell
and Dartmouth... and Williams is about equivalent to University of
Pennsylvania- point is, these are seriously good colleges!)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here are the rest of the hidden ivies by area- later
referred to as <!-- � Some trash from MS -->mid and low hidden ivies<!-- � Some trash from MS --> with the top hidden ivies known as

you should focus on math, history or art - whichever is the strongest interest.
Of course, this does not bind you to one field - it merely limits you from 20.

yourself into a college. Through hard work and careful planning, acceptance
should come naturally. Even on the interview, fake personalities should be
dropped. The point of the process is not competition - sometimes the right

have gotten in. He wandered about the spectrum of studies and did not seem to
care about art. He did not mention any art tournaments while he seemingly did
everything else. He did not appear to further his studies of art, seeming to
lack passion for it - which could have been reflected in his teacher
recommendations. He lied on his essay, which could have been revealed and would
have jeopardized the process. His second essay was useless as it only talked about
NJIT. The interview was not only off-topic but an evident fake. Herman may have
done MUN, but there was no indication of his altruistic passion. The admission
staff would know that he<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s a phony and dismiss him quite quickly. Also, Herman
would not have fit. He was going for art, nothing technologically involved. He
didn<!-- � Some trash from MS -->t need NJIT - in fact, he probably would not have fit.</p>

talented student. There are scholarships for art, academics, test scores and
sports. Some of these require separate applications through the college.
Naviance offers many similar scholarships with their own application. Few of
these are automatic, depending on the college. Many will require a minimum
college GPA among other things. Sports scholarships will require participation
in the sport and arts scholarships may require similar participation. Note that
such requirements only apply to merit-based scholarships - none of the other
types of aid would require these. Such scholarships do not need repayment.</p>

These
loans may be back-breaking burdens later in life (interest does accrue), but
they can also be used to good effect. Colleges will offer these loans and
need-based aid if you fill out their application. The application will be on
their website and generally requires various accounts. Usually this requires
the completion of a CSS profile or a similar application (look up online what
the CSS profile is). The CSS profile is connected to the college via the
college<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s CEEB code which can be found online or searched for when completing
the CSS profile. Tax information is required, including your parent<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s W2 forms
and many other tax figures, so do consult them at this stage. Sometimes, the
college may give need-based aid which does not need to be repaid, but loans
will have to be.</p>

loans. The FAFSA is used for federal financial aid. The HESAA is state aid for
New Jersey students attending public universities. Fortunately, the FAFSA links
directly to the IRS (the tax bureau of the USA), making the form-filling much easier.
Again, some of the offers may be loans which will need to be repaid while
others would be aid - essentially free money. One caveat is that filing the
FAFSA makes you eligible for the draft, if you<!-- � Some trash from MS -->re male.</p>

college to learn more about the applicant - to hear them and get a feel for
their voice. The essay must be written by you, for you and of you. You should
craft it in your best English, edit it laboriously and make sure that it<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s
about you while still answering the prompt. It is common to hear that <!-- � Some trash from MS -->if your
essay was found on the floor without your name on it, people should still
return it to you<!-- � Some trash from MS --> - few words from the guidance department are truer. The essay
should also reflect you honestly, in a positive light. It should work in your
favor - highlighting positives - while staying genuine and honest. Remember
that colleges can see through most facades. Also remember that admissions
officers will not read your work thoroughly - they cannot because they usually
lack the time. The essay is your space to reveal something new about yourself
within the bounds of the prompt - make it your best impression.</p>

Even if you have a sad story to tell, the ending should always be happy. This
is rooted mostly in psychology as you do not want to depress the admissions

overcoming, improving and growing. That way, you will sound like a better

650 (or fewer) focused words. This is difficult. Furthermore, your English must
be perfect or close. Mistakes would make your essay seem rushed, giving
colleges the impression that you don<!-- � Some trash from MS -->t care. Keeping the essay cohesive and
well-organized helps you and the reader understand the essay. This would help
you get your message across. Avoid slang, though prudent usage would let you
make certain points. In terms of the average essay you write for Language Arts,
the college essay has slightly more relaxed rules and flexible prompts. Still,
much of the Language Arts rubric applies as grammar, organization and response
to the prompt are vital. Also note that writing significantly below the word
limit gives the impression of a rushed essay or wastes your opportunity to
shine. Better grammar and organization will help the admissions officer
understand you and your essay and is an important part of your writing.</p>

introspective material is hard. We suggest you pick a prompt that you feel
better suits you and try this: get out lots of paper, a pencil and some sort of
timer. For 30 minutes, force yourself to re write the prompt in your own words
at the top and write whatever comes to your mind to answer the prompt on the
paper even if it is just scribbles and nonsense somehow relevant to the prompt
for 30 minutes straight. Eventually some good ideas will come out. From there
you refine your ideas, add new ones and begin the long process of writing and
rewriting and rewriting (having other people read it) until you think it is
good enough- which takes about a month.<!-- � Some trash from MS --> We suggest you also read lots of the

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>All of your grades in high school
impact this very important thing called your GPA. It is an abbreviation for <b>G</b>rade
<b>P</b>oint <b>A</b>verage. It is essentially one number that measures your
average level of academic grades. There are two types of GPA: weighted GPA and
unweighted GPA. Weighted GPA has no clear cap or limit on how high it can go.
Unweighted GPA has a cap at 4.0.<!-- � Some trash from MS --> Unweighted GPA simply measures how many A<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s,
B<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s or C<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s you have gotten in courses on average while weighted GPA takes into
consideration the difficulty of the course in assigning you a number. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>You assign each of the grades you
have gotten a number (A= 4, B= 3, C = 2 D = 1, F = 0) and find the average
number rounded to the second decimal place (so a 3.45 is a 3.5). On naviance,
the online helpful college tool that your high school provides you with, you
can compare this GPA (or you can compare weighted GPA, which is actually much
more useful) with the average of those who have gotten into a college. You do
this by searching for a college and clicking on the <!-- � Some trash from MS -->your school stats<!-- � Some trash from MS --> link.
To know how naviance works, pester your guidance counselor and ask him or her
to explain everything. </p>

school, the grade in the class is weighted such as 40% is homework and 60% is
tests. That just means your average test grade (total points earned/ total
points possible) is 60% of your marking period grade that marking period. This
weighting that is told to you usually on the first day just helps you determine
your marking period grade. If this is confusing, go ask your guidance counselor

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>GPA is very important for college.
Look at what people who have gotten into your target colleges have for their

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In this section we discuss what the
important courses are for you to take based on your interests. Then, we
describe the prerequisites of these main courses and some paths to get to take
them as well as describing the courses themselves (the difficulty, behavior of
teachers who teach the course etc.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><!-- � Some trash from MS -->We break up the groups of main courses as follows: a
math/science group, a computer science/math group, a history/writing group, and
an art group.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Note: AP courses prepare you for the AP test with AP
standing for Advanced Placement while AT courses- Advanced Topics often also
prepare you for AP tests but not always)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Important math/ science courses:</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is
taught by Ashton and Brienza. Both are experts, but Ashton is the nicer and

state, allowing credit to transfer directly from wherever you take the course
to high school. You will have to sign up for this at both the institution and
the high school - the high school must know that you are taking the course as

few numbers on the board. An example is 70% essays and 30% homework (this is
for an advanced English course). These numbers are vital. These numbers tell
you what assignments will most heavily impact your grade. Remember that if you

tests or projects. You will know about these well in advance - teachers give
you a week or more of warning for these. Here, standard studying is the safest
route. If you are familiar with how you study, stick to these familiar tactics.
That said, always remember to study in advance and stay relaxed and calm. If
you study early enough, you may find that you do not understand something, you
will have ample time to contact your teacher. If, instead, you study the night
before, you had better hope for a helpful friend or an unlikely postponement.</p>

bumping up. Remember that this is done by their choice. A mean teacher will
usually never ever bump you. Extra-credit is as if you got extra points on a
test. This may even make your score over 100% as extra-credit may be offered on
a test directly or afterwards. Bumping requires you to talk to your teacher.

however, can never hurt - just remember not to pester as this would reduce your
likelihood of being <!-- � Some trash from MS -->bumped up.<!-- � Some trash from MS --> The concept of bumping is that the teacher
will give you extra points to change a letter grade at the end of a marking

marking periods as you can then work hard to bring your grade up.</p>

switching depends on spaces in the course you would switch to (you always need

within your field. All competitions offer awards. They will rank you and higher
rankings are universally better. Winning in a competition over a larger area is
also better regardless of field. Note that it is valuable to be highly ranked,
not have merely participated in various competitions - it is quality not
quantity, it is better being within the top ten once instead of in the top 100
five times. Also, be very focused here and only compete where it is relevant to
your interests. College would prefer this and you will have a higher chance of
success. Look for the details of competitions within your field of interest as
prestige also matters - the competition should have a notable name and be a
trustworthy one, not a smaller unknown one.</p>

Internships are a diluted form of work - of an adult<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s daily job. You will
experience a workplace, a boss and infamous meetings. Some are paid and others
are not. The specific terms vary tremendously. Research is a subset of this,
allowing you to work on a professor<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s team (or something similar) as you dive
into new aspects of a field of your choosing. It is common to hear of hazing,

Having a LinkedIn profile is vital here as it will make you appear prepared to

a good way to start to claim that title. Research online through other means:

<p class=MsoNormal><b>In this section we will first explain the basic
standardized tests, the logistics (where you take them, how you send them
etc.), what the scores mean and finally how to actually get high scores.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>One of the simpler things colleges
consider are your scores. The process is mathematical: if your score is less
than that of the average applicant, you may be rejected if you don<!-- � Some trash from MS -->t have some
compensating factors. With details - such as extracurriculars and competitions
- come ways to be a little below the average scores, but scores are important
to colleges as they are one of the only things you submit that offer a
concrete-ish value.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

Checking the college<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s website, under admissions, within the <!-- � Some trash from MS -->incoming
freshman<!-- � Some trash from MS --> tab, would give you the most accurate information. Most schools
mandate an SAT or ACT with writing. Many also require SAT Subject tests. Almost
all allow the submission of AP tests. Note that some schools require you to
submit all your test scores while others let you submit only your best - look
up the term <!-- � Some trash from MS -->superscore<!-- � Some trash from MS --> and look up what your selected colleges <!-- � Some trash from MS -->superscore<!-- � Some trash from MS -->.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>SAT
and ACT: These are the broadest tests, designed to measure your overall performance
in college. In reality they measure nothing and have no value other than to
help you get into a college. They do not require any extra education as the
school<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s curriculum (at any level) will suffice. Scores on these tests are
known to correlate directly with your college GPA. Many colleges require at
least one score from these tests.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
SAT Subject Tests: These are narrower tests which look for a basic
understanding of topics- which is somewhat true. An honors-level course is
usually good preparation for these tests. Colleges may require two or more
scores from these.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>AP
Tests: These tests are a declaration that you are prepared to earn college
credits for a high-level high school course. Unlike the SAT or ACT, these tests
seriously test your understanding of the topics. Most high schools like ours
have AP courses designated to prepare you for these tests, but few tests must
be <!-- � Some trash from MS -->self-studied<!-- � Some trash from MS --> - studied for without official schooling. Note that while
courses relate to AP tests, the courses and tests are independent. You do not
need to take an AP test if you<!-- � Some trash from MS -->re in that AP course and you do not need to be
in an AP course to take an AP test.</p>

These state-ordained tests are an annual pain required for graduation. There
are two rounds of testing on a computer and tests last two hours. The founders
graduated before this test<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s implementation and are not well informed. <b>They

tests: These tests are rare and not required by US colleges. Ask your guidance
counselor about these tests as you most likely do not need to take them.
Unfortunately, the founders do not know much about these so this section does
not include any more information. It may be asked of you if you are not super
familiar with English (as in you need a translator to carry on a conversation
or listen to a lecture by a teacher) - if this applies to you- look up these
tests and perhaps take them and send them to your colleges. </p>

make an account with collegeboard.org and ACT Inc. The website has a
registration link where a form will ask about your school, age and the time and
place you would like to take the test. You can only register for three SAT
Subject Tests or the SAT at one time. Many local high schools are in this list:
Princeton High School, Hightstown High, Robbinsville and others. It is notable
that High School South has a reputation for being loud and somewhat distracting
due to its lack of walls. Tests are offered fairly regularly with SATs being
offered on the first weekend of most months that have school and the ACT being
offered on the weekend after. It is rumored that September and October tests
are easier, but there is little credibility to this. Remember to check online
for all the dates and details. You will be given a registration ticket after
registering. Do not lose this ticket. Note that you will need a photo
identification at your testing location and there is a fee for these tests.
Also pay careful attention to all the instructions as there are many strict
policies about electronics, calculators and cheating.</p>

on the school district<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s website. The guidance department will email you the
details for registration. The form will ask about the classes you have taken
and who your teacher is (more on why later) and you will be made to pay a $97
fee (or more) per test. Most of these tests will be taken in the new theatre at
High School South during the first two full weeks in May. Note that two weeks
prior to testing, there is a mandatory pre-gridding session which makes
test-taking much more convenient and will help you understand the process and
give you the times for the tests. In pre-gridding, you will fill out much of
the personal information required to give you your AP scores. You will do so on
an answer sheet - the one you will use for your first test two or three weeks
later. It<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s quite self-explanatory, but follow the instructions carefully to
guarantee getting your scores.</p>

via collegeboard and ACT scores can only be sent via ACT Inc. Using all three
services is the only way to be certain that colleges have all your scores. In
the form you will have to fill out, the websites (Collegeboard.org and the ACT
website) will provide a search feature. Also, these services charge between $10
and $20 for regular shipping. Scores generally get to colleges within two or three
weeks. Faster shipping is available, but at a higher price.</p>

similar institutions in our local area. As mentioned in the section above, High
School South is disreputable as a testing center due to its lack of walls.
Noises from other rooms can cause distractions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

water, but not too much since you<!-- � Some trash from MS -->ll usually finish in time for lunch (except
when taking an AP test, where you will be given time for lunch). Carry a
calculator if your test allows one - this makes everything much more
convenient. Make sure your calculator is charged. Carry multiple - 4 or more -
number two pencils. Mechanical pencils are not allowed and pens are usually not
needed (unless you<!-- � Some trash from MS -->re taking an AP test, at which point a pen is required).
Remember an eraser - a good, clean one; maybe two. Keep the pencils sharp (and
your mind sharper) and carry a sharpener. If your watch makes any noise (a
brief bleep on the hour, for instance) turn the sound off or don<!-- � Some trash from MS -->t carry the
watch. Do not worry about time-keeping, you can expect a working clock in every
testing room. That clock has to be visible to you by mandate of the
collegeboard and ACT Inc. You should carry your phone, especially if dropped
off by parents, but leave it off throughout testing. Do not touch it, even
during breaks. You need not carry anything else (unless you have classes
afterwards which may happen while taking AP tests). Be sure to dress in layers
as you will never know what climate your testing room will have - some are
Arctic while others are sub-Saharan, regardless of the season. Also use the
bathroom beforehand or you may end up running to the bathroom and perhaps (we
don<!-- � Some trash from MS -->t know) getting into trouble of leaving the test in a non-break time
period.</p>

ACT - usually on a Saturday morning by 7:45 AM at the latest - you will be
asked for a photo identification and your registration ticket. You will then be
pointed to a room. Each center has a slightly different process for this, but
rooms and seats are assigned and arranged alphabetically by last name. Note
that SATs and SAT Subject Tests are taken in different rooms. You will then see
your proctor, usually a teacher at the high school. They will take your phone
and check your calculator. Eventually, once the room is filled or it is past 8
AM (the time the test usually starts), the proctor will begin to read
instructions and hand out materials. Pay attention and follow these.</p>

as you are quiet. Do not touch your phone! Note that these breaks happen at
different times as some proctors are slower than others. Due to this, you may
be on break while others are testing. Respect the testing environment and do
not make too much noise. Also, return to your testing room on time as proctors
will not wait for you and you will lose testing time.</p>

unique in the way they are taken. You will be given an answer sheet with spaces
for three tests and a booklet with every test. Obviously, do not read the tests
that you are not taking. A table of contents will give you the correct page
numbers to turn to for everything. Each test is an hour long. You can sit
through three tests - even if you did not register for all of them (though you
will always be billed for these tests later). Indicate the correct test and
take it. Each test has its own rules, so pay attention to the instructions.</p>

The ACT
has 5 sections. First is the English section. In this, you are given five
passages and must correct grammatical and spelling-related issue. You will also
be asked about modifications to the passage<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s structure. Note that this is a
multiple choice section and each of the 75 questions has 4 possible answers.
This section takes 45 minutes. After this comes an hour long math section with
60 questions that have 5 choices each. Usually, there is a break here. Next
comes a reading section (reading comprehension), with four passages: one
fictional, one biographical and two non-fiction (usually one on the humanities
and one on a hard science). They generally appear in the order above and
decrease in length as you proceed through the section. This section takes 35
minutes and each of the 40 questions has 4 answer choices. The science section
follows. Here you are given data from 7 different sources and must analyze it
or create experiments to test claims for six of these. The seventh passage (not
always the last one in the test booklet) is a set of passages that disagree on
a scientific topic and you are asked questions about their disagreement and any
specific information from any of these mini-passages. This section lasts 35
minutes and has 40 questions. Finally, after another break, you may take the
essay. This is an optional 30 minute written piece that you have to register for
when registering for the rest of the test. You are asked to argue a point on
the simple topic, such as <!-- � Some trash from MS -->why uniforms are good for schools<!-- � Some trash from MS --> or something
equally mundane. Organization and clarity are key. The graders are looking for
you to make well-reasoned and clearly conveyed points (we<!-- � Some trash from MS -->ll explain how to do
this later). You do not need a pen here as the essay will be written in pencil.</p>

to know. Collegeboard.org has a lot of useful information on this. Usually,
there is a short break between the multiple-choice and free-response portions
and each section takes around 90 minutes. A pen is needed for the beginning of
the free-response and may also be used within the section.</p>

Sometimes, it is merely multiplied by some factor to change the denominator.
Other times, the scores are <!-- � Some trash from MS -->standardized,<!-- � Some trash from MS --> meaning that only a certain
percentile gets each score. The latter makes getting higher scores harder as

standardized tests (except for AP tests) do not test your intelligence or
academic knowledge. Do not be upset if your score at first is not as high as
you want it to be (or as high as some of your friends). Almost everyone who
earns very high scores puts in months of daily effort- though he or she may not

should aim to be well above (SAT: 150 points above, ACT: 2-4 points above) the
average SAT score or ACT score of the ideal college you are shooting/aiming

prep books will tell you to do a lot of reading before these tests to prepare
for the reading section. That is spot on. You should do a lot of reading- like
20-30 pages a day of a book for a month before the date of the test (and don<!-- � Some trash from MS -->t
choose an easy read- read a book that you would read in school like the scarlet

helping you earn a good score, I would like to mention that although this
process looks intimidating, do not worry. Complete idiots have gone through it
and done very well. Why? Well, because these tests do not measure intelligence.
They measure how much effort you put into studying- whether or not you actually
study with like 3 practice tests a week for 5-6 weeks (of course being <i>intelligent
</i>and understanding what <i>types</i> of problems you get wrong while
studying) determines your score. </p>

The club meets at some
regular time- say Mondays after school in some specified room that usually
stays the same. You get there, attendance is taken and the club<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s officers
(another word for leaders- these are fellow high school students usually a year
older than you, many of them seniors) run the club meeting preparing you for
the next competition or even the club will host or attend. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>How to Become a Leader While In a Club</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --> </b>Clubs hold some sort of electoral process
that allows people who have attended the club often to vote for their officers.
Usually, when the senior officers are leaving a few spots open up allowing
juniors and sophomores to earn officership. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --> So when a club is holding an election, it will
usually a lot a few minutes for you to give a speech- make it reasonable and
something that connections with your audience. If you are giving one: make
inside jokes and just keep it brief and honest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Club members usually select a club
member who is really into the club or very good at the club<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s competitions or
activities as well as a regular member (good attendance)-someone who scored
very highly on competitions or led the club and the school<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s name to victory in
competitions usually wins. So, to become an officer, the simplest path is to
get really into the club, talk to the officers a lot on how to improve at
whatever activity you are doing, put the time and effort in to become very
skilled at the club<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s activities/ competitions. Leadership will follow suit.
Note: you should do this hard work during your freshman and sophomore years
especially since having leadership for your junior and senior year in a club
looks very strong (in short, start trying for leadership and working hard at a
club very early). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>How to Make Your Own Club</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --> It is possible to make your own club. Colleges
love it if you can make a successful club that goes to competitions and
attracts a lot of members. However, this is very hard to do and most new clubs
fail horribly because the founders don<!-- � Some trash from MS -->t have enough time or willpower to make
the club thrive. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --> Here is how to do so. Call the school or ask
your guidance counselor for club starting form well before the first week of
school ends. Fill out the form and keep a copy of the form for yourself before
you hand it in (for your own records). To really make things good, type your
form up instead of hand writing answers to the questions on the form and get a
lot of followers to sign your form. Keep your form clean, neat, and filled with
very reasonable, concise answers that don<!-- � Some trash from MS -->t put the school at risk and instead
brighten the character of the school. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --> Once you submit the form before the deadline,
keep going to the vice principle around December (since clubs start in January)
and pester him or her about meeting with you (and any other co-founders if
there are some) about the club. Once you set a meeting, be sure to not miss it.
At this meeting, the vice principal will assess your club and how viable it is.
Have a clear message for the value for the club and be nice, respectful and
know how the day- to day operations of the club will run. Also have a plan for
club officership and how it passes on - how you vote etc.</p>

and a time you meet as well as a folder in which you need to keep track of what
you do at each club meeting and get it signed by some advisor. If you are able
to keep great track of this paperwork and keep the club active, meetings full
of interesting material, the people who show up engaged and fulfilled- you can
have a successful club that will perhaps live on after you have left high
school. This is very hard to do though and usually never happens.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Why Partake in Sports</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --> Sports can be very useful additions to your
college application. They can, in fact make up the bulk of your application. It
depends on your own performance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --> Colleges care about skill, not variety. Being
the best at one sport is more important than mediocrity in five. Skill will be
measured by your performance at games and your record with the coaches. You
coach may recommend you to colleges if not their coaches themselves. This is notably
important, especially in liberal arts schools.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --><!-- � Some trash from MS --> Colleges can see sports as club-like activities,
but also a valuable part of your application as you can be nationally ranked
here, making sports more like competitions. Also, note that your other accolades
can always be added to by sports are colleges welcome this dynamism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

based on skills in a sport. Look at the college website to know how to apply.
Contact relevant coaches and stay polite. Remember that you are a mere
applicant and they have no reason to help you unless your skill provides them
any reason. Remember that these grants have various terms and may bind you to
the college<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s team.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

for collegiate athletics. If a college is in the NCAA division 1, it is
extremely competitive and likely to offer you athletic scholarships. The higher
the division, the less likely such grants become. Note that in many places
within the NCAA gender matters. Details are here: <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/"><span

a sports team. The team must play and the team must win. You must play well,
occasionally in front of spectators, if you want to be a part of the team.
Usually, varsity members are seniors or juniors with the junior varsity players
are younger. Skill can cause exceptions as policies vary. Varsity matters more
as just the term <!-- � Some trash from MS -->varsity<!-- � Some trash from MS --> can add to your college application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>This is sort of important- and just
another one of those things you kind of need to do for college (like
standardized tests) and everyone should have some volunteering. We recommend
that you accumulate about a 100 hours over the course of 3 years of high school

volunteering doesn't have some theme like say working with animals and
volunteering at different shelters or maybe some theme like helping educate
underprivileged children through a variety of tutoring programs or non-profits.</p>

needed. Money from a job is useful if you have a way to use it. Talk over this
with your parents as your income would add to their taxes and your form filling
when applying for financial aid and your parents may prefer you to work or may
hate the prospect. This would also establish contacts, especially with bosses
who may write your recommendations, but unless your job is relevant to your
field of interest, a professor or teacher may be a more useful recommender.</p>

positions to be held. The clerks at immigration desks or behind the windows at
over-crowded social-security offices come to mind. These people exist for
service but do not have much knowledge and, being public workers, are not at
the forefront of their field. These workers are Band-Aids used to patch
together the gash of massive public demand. The high school guidance counsellor
is a prime example of this. They do not exist to serve you but exist to serve
the system and act as grease in its large, grinding cogs. Because of this
purpose, they cannot be expected to fully aid students. They have too general a
purpose and too big a job. They simply cannot care too much. They simply cannot
suggest certain things. We must note, however, that not all guidance counselors
are created equal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The Role of a Guidance Counselor</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The role a GC should play in a
student's life is to explain all the information in this document and give
personalized advice on what helps the most for someone<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s specific situation.
This role is basically never fulfilled. Hence, we (the founders) created this
document. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>However, for those who would like
personalize guidance on getting ready for colleges and don<!-- � Some trash from MS -->t mind paying
thousands for very informed, extremely helpful guidance, contact private
guidance counselors such as admissions navigator: <a

or ivywise: <a href="http://www.ivywise.com/"><span style='color:#1155CC'>http://www.ivywise.com/</span></a>
for <!-- � Some trash from MS -->real guidance<!-- � Some trash from MS -->. These people are very expensive, but have a high

discourage students from taking challenging courses and many who have listened
have ended up taking courses that are way too easy for them. We do not
understand why this happens, but must warn against it: do not be fooled by your
counsellor. If you think that you are capable, take the challenge. Do not stop
because of a stranger. They may know the system, but they do not know you. And,
if you pay attention in class, you will know the system as well. Enforce your
will when scheduling. There is little the GC can do to stop you. Then, the only
person stopping you would be yourself. Please never listen to their <!-- � Some trash from MS -->advice<!-- � Some trash from MS --> on

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>For a variety of reasons, colleges
compare male applicants with other male applicants and female ones with other
females. As a result, females competing for good schools need only be better
than their female peers and vice versa. For some reason, it happens that males
tend to have stronger resumes making it more challenging for a male to get into
a good school than a females. Simply put, compare yourself with other students
of your gender in your school aiming for the same colleges as you. This also
means females can do less (not a whole lot less, but a little) of the items on
the lists in the <!-- � Some trash from MS -->what colleges look for<!-- � Some trash from MS --> section and achieve the same result. </p>

a reasonable stem focus and good scores. As a result, because schools compare
students of similar ethnicities (to get a good mix or diverse student body),
Asians need to be more competitive than non- Asians to get into great schools.
However, we have accounted for this on the lists in the <!-- � Some trash from MS -->what colleges look
for<!-- � Some trash from MS --> section so if you follow that reasonable you are fine. For non-Asians, you
have it easier at low hidden ivies but your race actually make very little

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Here we just want to mention that
the college process is not really a stressful one. Students just get upset
feeing like they <b>have to</b> do something critical to their entire life, and
something serious is happening in their life that puts great responsibility on
them making a large fear set in of getting into a bad college and going nowhere
in life while people around you get into ivy leagues and so on. First of all,
there are thousands of people who don<!-- � Some trash from MS -->t get into Rutgers and there are so many
Rutgers grads that have done so well. Know that 80% our school gets into
Rutgers- you can coast if you want to. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><!-- � Some trash from MS -->Know that, yes, the process is a little
stressful and impacts your life deeply but so do other mandatory things that an
adult does like buying a car, choosing a life insurance policy or accepting a
job. Just because it is a big deal, it doesn<!-- � Some trash from MS -->t mean you should stress over it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Moreover, in this document we
explain almost everything you need to know about getting into good colleges. If
you take 4 hours a day for 3 days and try to plan out the courses you should
take in the next few years, the standardized tests you should take-often based
on the courses and so on ( make a general timeline for yourself) you can easily
accomplish many things that will seriously help you for college. You don<!-- � Some trash from MS -->t have
to be the best in the entire world- just being in the top 35-45% of our high
school<!-- � Some trash from MS -->s students (which you can easily do with this document) is great and
will lead to a happy life. Believe me, when you go to a college far away from
high school, you will feel so much smarter.<!-- � Some trash from MS --> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In brief, just dive into the
process of thoroughly planning out the things you need to do for college- the
timing, what courses, what clubs, volunteering, and maybe sports without
anxiety because you have all the information at your fingertips with this
document. The only way you will feel stressed is if you keep scaring yourself and
thinking that nothing good comes out of this entire process- that all this hard
work is so confusing and you are drowning in some chaos. Just use this document
to get organized and then once you have a plan, trust yourself and fearlessly
chase your goals.<!-- � Some trash from MS --> </p>
